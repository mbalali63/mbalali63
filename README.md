# I am Mahdi

## About Me

I earned my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (Iran) in 2010. Over the past decade, I've cultivated extensive experience as a mechanical engineer, specializing in the centrifugal pump industry. Additionally, I've amassed considerable expertise in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, utilizing both commercial software and custom code development.

Witnessing the rapid evolution of technology has fueled my curiosity about the future of our world. Recently, I've made the bold decision to transition from a traditional mechanical engineering role to actively contributing to technological advancements. To facilitate this transition, I'm currently enhancing my knowledge and skills to embark on a career as a developer.

As I embark on this journey towards a new professional horizon, I'm enthusiastic about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. I'm eager to leverage my background in engineering and my newfound passion for software development to make meaningful contributions to the tech community.

Your support and guidance as I navigate this transition would be immensely appreciated as I strive to accelerate my progress and make a positive impact in the world of technology.

## Roadmap
 As a freshman in my new field, I am tracking the roadmap provided in roadmap.sh for Full stack developer. you can find it [here](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack).

## Mastery Pursuit
To improve my skills in this new field, I am trying different choices and tools, day by day. Here I mention some of them:
### [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/mbalali63)
Frontend Mentor is a great website, designed to improve skills for everyone who wants to become a front end developer. I have done some of its challenges, that you can find on my [Frontend Mentor profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/mbalali63), and also on my [github repositories](https://github.com/mbalali63?tab=repositories). You can also find some of them below:<br>

### [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)
I used the interactive course of Scrimba, 'Learn React', provided by [Bob Ziroll](https://github.com/bobziroll). That was free and really good.

### [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
I have started my journey to the world of web development, by reviewing few courses of W3Schools: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.


## Chalenges:
 To keep myself fresh, with what I have learned, and find my weaknesses, I am always taking part in different challenges. I can mention some of theme below:

## Publications
To improve my knowledge, I am always reading papers from experienced developers. From when I was a mechanical engineer, I used to love researching and writing. So, now I have a plan to do researches about practical subjects in web-development and related topics, and provide the results with my friends.


## Projects
web development is practice and practice. So I am always working on projects, either during my courses, pr defined by myself. Most of them are on my [github repositories](https://github.com/mbalali63?tab=repositories). Some of them are deployed on [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and you can find the links below:
